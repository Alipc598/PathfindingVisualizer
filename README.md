# Pathfinding Visualizer

PathfindingVisualizer is an interactive built with the Kivy framework. It's designed to demonstrate the workings of A* and Branch and Bound, in a visually engaging and intuitive way based on scenarios of my Pathfinding project.

## Features

- **Interactive menu**: Click to create predefined obstacles, start points, and end points on a grid.
- **Algorithm Selection**: Choose between A* and Branch and Bound algorithms to see how each one navigates the grid. (Will probably add more later)
- **Real-Time Visualization**: Watch the algorithm in action as it searches for the shortest path.
- **Performance Metrics**: View the number of nodes explored and the time taken for each algorithm run.

## Downloading the Release

You can download the latest version of PathfindingVisualizer from the Releases section of this repository. The release includes a standalone executable file that you can run on your system.
