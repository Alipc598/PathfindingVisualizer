# Pathfinding Visualizer

PathfindingVisualizer is an interactive built with the Kivy framework. It's designed to demonstrate the workings of A* and Branch and Bound, in a visually engaging and intuitive way based on scenarios of my Pathfinding project.

## Features

- **Interactive menu**: Click to create predefined obstacles, start points, and end points on a grid.
- **Algorithm Selection**: Choose between A* and Branch and Bound algorithms to see how each one navigates the grid. (Will probably add more later)
- **Real-Time Visualization**: Watch the algorithm in action as it searches for the shortest path.
- **Performance Metrics**: View the number of nodes explored and the time taken for each algorithm run.

## Installation

To run PathfindingVisualizer, you need Python and Kivy installed on your system. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Alipc598/PathfindingVisualizer.git
   ```
   
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Navigate to the cloned directory and install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install pyinstaller
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   python Pathfinding-Visualizer.py
   ```

## Usage

After launching PathfindingVisualizer, use the following steps to interact with the application:

1. **Select a Grid Layout**: Choose a pre-defined grid layout.
2. **Choose an Algorithm**: Select the algorithm you want to visualize from the dropdown menu.
3. **Run the Visualizer**: Click the 'Run' button to start the pathfinding process. The path, along with performance metrics, will be displayed.
